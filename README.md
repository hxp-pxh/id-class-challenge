## Module 11 Challenge: Web Scraping and Data Analysis

## Overview

This challenge involves a comprehensive web scraping and data analysis project. You will leverage your knowledge of HTML elements, Splinter for automated browsing, Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing, and data analysis techniques to gather and analyze data related to Mars. The project consists of two main parts, each with its specific tasks.

## Contents

Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

## Jupyter Notebook: part_1_mars_news.ipynb

Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

## Jupyter Notebook: part_2_mars_weather.ipynb

You will complete both parts to demonstrate your web scraping and data analysis skills.

## Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

In this section, you will use automated browsing with Splinter to visit the Mars News website and perform web scraping with Beautiful Soup to extract titles and preview text from Mars news articles. The extracted data will be stored in Python data structures and optionally saved to a JSON file.

## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

The second part involves scraping and analyzing Mars weather data from the Mars Temperature Data Site. You will use automated browsing to navigate the web page and extract data from an HTML table. The scraped data will be structured into a Pandas DataFrame with appropriate column headings. You will then analyze the data to answer specific questions and create visualizations. The final step is to export the DataFrame to a CSV file.

## Objectives

Utilize automated browsing, Splinter, and Beautiful Soup to extract data from web pages.
Store scraped data in Python data structures and optionally export it to files.
Assemble scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame with correct data types.
Analyze the data to answer questions and create visualizations.
Export the analyzed data to a CSV file for future reference.
Tools Used
Splinter for automated web browsing
Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
Jupyter Notebook for code execution and documentation
